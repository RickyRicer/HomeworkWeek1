# Horiseon Code Refactor

Week 1 homework assignment, refactor code for the Horiseon Social Solutions webpage. By following the "Scout Rule," I hope you'll find this code cleaner than what was originally being used. 


## Lessons Learned

This was a fun and challenging project, as CSS is totally new to me. Revisiting old HTML tags, elements, etc. is something that I haven't looked at in almost 20 years. Learning about HTML semantics, and consolidation of CSS code are the biggest takeaways I have from this. 
  
## Screenshots

This is my first attempt at readme screenshots. It did disappoint.
